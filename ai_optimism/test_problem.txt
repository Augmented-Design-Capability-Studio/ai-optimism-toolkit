cookies:
I'm optimizing a recipe for cookies in terms of the only two variables baking_temperature and flour_type. 

I want to maximize the cakey-ness.



can you generate a sample cookie recipe optimization problem for me? I want to maximize protein with 500g of total ingredients. You can define other variables, properties, and constraints as you see fit.
